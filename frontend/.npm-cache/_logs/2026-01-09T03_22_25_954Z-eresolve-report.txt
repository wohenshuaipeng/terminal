# npm resolution error report

While resolving: goterm-frontend@0.0.0
Found: xterm@undefined
node_modules/xterm
  xterm@"^5.5.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer xterm@"^5.0.0" from xterm-addon-fit@0.8.0
node_modules/xterm-addon-fit
  xterm-addon-fit@"^0.8.0" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
